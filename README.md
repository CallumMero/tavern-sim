# Tavern Sim

A text-first, UI-driven fantasy tavern simulator with retro styling.

## Run

Open `index.html` in your browser.

No build step is required.

## Current Vertical Slice

- Daily simulation loop with finances, reputation, and guest demand
- Inventory production (brew/cook) and supply purchasing
- Staff hiring/training and payroll pressure
- Tavern condition/cleanliness systems
- Random events with immediate economic impact
- Retro interface with event log and management controls

## Next Target

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the plan to evolve this into a deep manager-style sim.
