## Current Vertical Slice

- Daily simulation loop with finances, reputation, and guest demand
- Inventory production (brew/cook) and supply purchasing
- Staff hiring/training and payroll pressure
- Tavern condition/cleanliness systems
- Random events with immediate economic impact
- Named patron pool with cohort preferences and loyalty-driven demand pressure
- Rota presets with staff fatigue, injuries, and disputes
- Ingredient quality/freshness tracking with spoilage impact on production
- Daily report summaries for finance, operations, staffing, and guest sentiment
- Retro interface with event log and management controls

## Next Target

See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for the plan to evolve this into a deep manager-style sim.
